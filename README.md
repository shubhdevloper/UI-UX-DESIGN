APPLE MUSIC 
As part of my UI redesign project, I chose to reimagine the Apple Music interface with a focus on visual clarity, content accessibility, and user experience. Below is a brief summary of the design decisions I made during the redesign process:

1. Dark Mode Focus
I retained the dark theme to ensure a modern, immersive music-listening experience that reduces eye strain and allows colorful album artwork and interface elements to stand out more vibrantly.

2. Sidebar Simplification and Structure
I structured the left navigation panel into three clear sections:

Core Features: Listen Now, Browse, Search, and Radio for easy access to key music discovery tools.

Library Access: Recently Added, Artists, Albums, and Songs, giving users direct control over their personal collection.

Playlists: All Playlists and Liked Songs grouped for quick access to user-curated content.

Icons were included for each option to improve visual recognition and navigation speed.

3. Improved Search Interface
Under the Search tab, I introduced a large, central search bar to focus user attention. Below it, a “Recently Searched” section helps users resume their exploration quickly without needing to remember exact titles.

4. Browse by Category (Grid Layout)
To enhance discoverability, I implemented a grid-based layout for music categories like:

Spatial Audio

Dance/Electronics

R&B

K-Pop

Charts, Chill, etc.

This layout encourages exploration by showing visual previews of genres with engaging thumbnails.

5. Persistent & Elegant Music Player
I redesigned the bottom music player to remain fixed, offering easy control over playback without disrupting the browsing experience. It features:

Album cover preview

Song title and artist

Dolby Atmos tag for quality indication

Essential controls like play/pause, forward, and volume slider

This minimalist approach keeps the focus on content while offering utility.

6. Unified Visual Theme
To maintain design consistency, I used a cohesive color palette with a magenta/pink highlight for active states, hover effects, and icons. Rounded corners, spacious layouts, and consistent typography were applied to improve readability and aesthetic balance.
